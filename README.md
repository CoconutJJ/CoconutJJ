# 👋 Hi there, I'm David Yue

I'm currently a **Ph.D. student in Computer Science** at the **University of Utah**, advised by [Dr. Mary Hall](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~mhall/). My research interests lie in **HPC**, **Machine Learning Systems**, and **Compilers**.

Previously:
- 🧠 Machine Learning Research Engineer at **Huawei**
- 🎓 Undergraduate at **University of Toronto** (Honours B.Sc. with Distinction in CS and Math, 2022)

## 💻 Projects & Interests

- 🧪 I enjoy working on systems-level software, compilers, and numerical programming.
- ✨ Built a [Path and Ray Tracer](https://github.com/CoconutJJ/rt) while self-learning computer graphics.
- 📚 Strongly recommend *[Physically Based Rendering](https://pbr-book.org/)* if you're interested in rendering.
- 🛠️ I love writing C and building low-level infrastructure tools.

## 🧰 Services

- 🖥️ I run [Vancouver Web Studio](http://vancouverwebstudio.ca)
- 🎓 I offer [tutoring](https://davidyue.me/tutoring) for K–12 and undergraduate CS students, especially in systems topics.
- 📝 I provide **free Statement of Purpose (SoP) reviews** for CS Ph.D. applicants. Just send an email with **[SoP Review]** in the subject:  
  📧 `davidyue5819@gmail.com`

> Please treat my advice as guidance from personal experience — I'm not on any admissions committee. I’ve also written a [blog post about my application process](https://davidyue.me/posts/graduate-application-process/).

## 🧠 Teaching & Experience

I’ve served as a Teaching Assistant for the following University of Toronto courses:

- Software Tools and Systems Programming  
- Operating Systems  
- Introduction to Numerical Algorithms for Computational Mathematics  
- Computer and Network Security

Previously, I interned at **Shopify** and **BlackBerry** through UofT's co-op program.

## 🧒 A Little More About Me

I grew up in Richmond, BC 🇨🇦 and attended:

- 🏫 [Robert A. McMath Secondary School](https://mcmath.sd38.bc.ca)
- 🧮 [John G. Diefenbaker Elementary](https://diefenbaker.sd38.bc.ca)

Despite struggling academically in early years (yes, straight C's in Grade 4!), I found my stride in math, physics, and computing later on. I've always been quiet, but persistent.
